JumpStart2D 
============= 
 
A simple 2D C++ game framework using SDL and Box2D. JumpStart2D is modeled after my favourite bits of FlashPunk. 
 
Goal: 
The intended purpose for this framework is to provide a legitimate jumping off point for game development using C++. 
The logic, engine structure and interfaces was adapted and ported from FlashPunk.
